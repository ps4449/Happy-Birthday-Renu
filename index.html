		<p>Today is the 20th birthday of a precious friend Renu. It is not everyday a person turns 20, and it is an occasion to celebrate. However, due to COVID-19, there has been a rather sad situation. After living alone through two semesters without the support of her friends or boyfriend, Renu has only had more time to complain and crib about the fact that she is alone at home, and none of her friends are there with her, and people are pissed with her. But, on her birthday, her friends would like to let her know that we love and appreciate her a lot, even when she completely dissociates from society and friendship on multiple occassions. After all, our Renu is amazing.</p>

		<p>Renu's traits: None of us have had the misfortune of knowing Renu from the tender age of 1, but from the way she orients herself now, it is very evident that she was not, in fact, so tender. Renu is easily identifiable in her old photos because her racoon-like status has only gotten worse through the years. The only difference now is that she has bangs. In addition to doing the bare minimum, Renu's kinks are worrying about exams till she has a near-death experience, randomly appearing in group chats with no context, liking none of the good food her mother cooks, deleting Instagram only to appear on it some hours later, forgetting to eat till she has a near-death experience. A wild creature indeed.</p>

		<p>Lastly, we probably have the only genuine birthday wish, from Vaibhav to you <3:
			<br>
			<br>I am Vaibhav Singh, I reside in renu's heart, and Renu resides in mine. We are very close to being a chhapra chhapri combo at this point, but we really couldn't care less. And we reside in each other's hearts. i fell in love with her for the first time I met her, and then again the day after and then again the day after that and so on. I have never thought of hurting renu. Intentionally or Unintentionally. Renu is my love and I am renu's and? you guessed it! We reside in each other's hearts :)
			<br>
			<br>Happy birthday, Renu!

		<p>Well, one might ask what this website hopes to accomplish, other than providing large amounts of cringe. But in the end, we all want you to know that you really are loved and appreciated through all your disappearances, quirks and everything else. Things would definitely be better on campus, and it sucks that it's been a year since we've all seen each other, but we haven't forgotten everything we've missed out on. We'll catch up on it all soon enough. Lastly, I hope you can come here for some lols, gags and comfort. Happy birthday, Renu!!
